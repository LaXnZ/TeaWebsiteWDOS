                <h2>Sri Lanka’s Tea Growing Areas</h2>
                    <p class="box">
                    There are a number of Sri Lankan tea plantations covering large areas of the Hill Country,
                    so the chances are you won’t be too far from one wherever you are in Sri Lanka.  
                    The main tea growing areas in Sri Lanka are :</p>

                    <ul class ="dottedList1">
                    <li>Kandy</li>
                    <li>Nuwara Eliya</li>
                    <li>Uda Pussellawa (between Nuwara Eliya and Ella)</li>
                    <li>Uva (area around Ella and Badulla)</li>
                    <li>Sabaragamuwa (sweeping from west of Kandy down past Horton plains and to Udawalawe)</li>
                    <li>Dimbulla (between Hatton and Nuwara Eliya)</li>
                    <li>Ruhuna (southern province of Sri Lanka encompassing Yala)</li> </ul>

                    <p class = "box">The tea produced varies depending on where it’s grown. The higher the elevation, the lighter 
                    and subtler the tea. Higher elevation tea plantations are found around Haputale and Nuwara Eliya. <br>

                    The lower the elevation, the stronger and less subtle the tea. Lower elevation tea plantations 
                    are found near the coast in the area around Galle, where you’ll find plenty of things to do and 
                    also in Matara.</p>

              </div>

                <h2 class="titles"><b>Nuwara Eliya Region </b>(High Grown Tea) </h2>

              <div class="grid-container2">
                <img class="box1"  src="images/nuwara.jpg" alt="nuwara-eliya-tea-estate">

                <p  class="box2-2" >
                    Other than its cold climate, scenic views, and high elevation, Nuwara Eliya 
                    is known for its lush tea gardens. Cold and wet in climate except during the 
                    dry season, the rainfall in the area is moderate. <br> <br>

                    This unique terrain and the climate collaborate to produce some of the finest 
                    and most celebrated teas in the world. Tea plantations at Nuwara Eliya are 
                    situated 6,128 ft above sea level, while most of them fall under the shadow of 
                    Pidurutalagala, the highest mountain in Sri Lanka. Nuwara Eliya tea enjoys two 
                    seasons where they deliver their best output in two seasons. They are the “Eastern season” 
                    and the “Western season”. Tea leaves from Nuwara Eliya create a greenish-yellow tone 
                    when infused and are the palest infusion among all the Ceylon Tea varieties. <br> <br>

                    While the region is located at the very centre of the hill country, the balance 
                    between its two main climatic seasons may vary from estate to estate. 
                    The rarefied and refined quality of Nuwara Eliya tea perfectly sets itself 
                    apart from lower-grown varieties. The high altitude of the region results 
                    in the growth of a bush with smaller leaves that have an orange hue. Just 
                    like other tea varieties, high mountain tea is also available in different grades. 
                    One thing to note about Nuwara Eliya tea is that the smaller the leaf particle is, 
                    the stronger and less subtle the tea is.

              <h2 class="titles"><b>Ruhuna Region </b>(Low Grown) </h2>

              <div class="grid-container2">
                <img class="box1"  src="images/ruhuna.jpg" alt="ruhuna">

                <p  class="box2-2" >
                    More focus was given to making tea prioritized cultivation around the year 1900,  
                    where estates were opened up at the foothills of the central country. At this time,
                    most of the plantations were owned by the British. Back then, the Ceylonese planting 
                    fraternity was at practice. This was a group that specialized in the plantation of tea, 
                    rubber, and other crops. When it came to the 1970s, political and economic changes 
                    in the middle east resulted in an increased demand for strong, black, flavoured teas 
                    in the international markets. This made Ruhuna tea a speciality. With the help from 
                    that boost, Ruhuna remains to be one of the key-tea producing districts in the country, 
                    followed by Sabaragamuwa. <br> <br>

                    Both of these provinces account for 60% of Sri Lanka’s total tea production. 
                    The tea estates of Ruhuna lie at sea level and 2000 ft from that. It is a low-grown variety. 
                    The climatic conditions available in the area prevents the trees from receiving the full force 
                    of the southwest monsoon winds. Before tea, most of these cultivation zones were occupied 
                    by spice growers. The soil in the district is rich enough to support any plantation. It helps 
                    the tea bush to grow rapidly while producing a long, beautiful leaf that turns black when withered.

              <h2 class="titles"><b>Kandy Region </b>(medium grown tea) </h2>

              <div class="grid-container2">
                <img class="box1"  src="images/kandy.jpg" alt="kandy">

                <p  class="box2-2" >
                    Kandy has always played a key role in the tea industry in Sri Lanka. 
                    As a part of the hill country, the area has a cool climate and high moisture 
                    in the soil. The cultivation altitude of Kandy ranges between 650m and 1300m, 
                    or  2000 - 4000 ft above sea level. Just like other regions that follow, Kandy 
                    tea has its flavour influenced by its growth elevation.<br><br>

                    A cup of Kandy tea carries a lighter colour than the other teas. Estates of 
                    the region are mostly located at the western slopes of the hills. The quality 
                    of their products is by the “Western-quality season”. This means that the best 
                    Kandy tea is produced during the first quarter of the season. <br><br>

                    The strength of a tea plantation is inversely proportional to its elevation. 
                    As a result, Kandy tea grown at a higher elevation results in small leaves that 
                    deliver a subtle and delicate flavour when compared to the tea grown at a lower 
                    elevation, where the leaves are larger and have a stronger flavour. <br><br>

                    Kandy tea is also available in a range of grades and leaf particle sizes. 
                    The leaf particle size can affect the strength of the brew. Kandy teas have
                    a bright infusion with a coppery tone. It has a strong flavour even though 
                    it appears to be light in the cup.

                the altitude and whether the plantation is sheltered from monsoon 
                winds. All are particularly flavoursome. Kandy teas produce a bright
